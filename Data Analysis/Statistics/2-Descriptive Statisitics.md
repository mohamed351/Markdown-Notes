## Analyzing Quantitative Data
## Four Aspects for Quantitative Data
### There are four main aspects to analyzing Quantitative data.

#### Measures of Center
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
### The Mean

```
In this video, we focused on the calculation of the mean. The mean is often called the average or the expected value in mathematics. We calculate the mean by adding all of our values together, and dividing by the number of values in our dataset.

```

```
Which of the below are measures of center (Check all that apply)?
Mean 
Median 
Mode
```

```
If we have the data:

5, 8, 15, 7, 10, 22, 3, 1, 15
What is the mean?
9.56
```
### The Median
```
he median splits our data so that 50% of our values are lower and 50% are higher. We found in this video that how we calculate the median depends on if we have an even number of observations or an odd number of observations.

Median for Odd Values
If we have an odd number of observations, the median is simply the number in the direct middle. For example, if we have 7 observations, the median is the fourth value when our numbers are ordered from smallest to largest. If we have 9 observations, the median is the fifth value.

Median for Even Values
If we have an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two values in the middle. For example, if we have 8 observations, we average the fourth and fifth values together when our numbers are ordered from smallest to largest.

In order to compute the median we MUST sort our values first.

Whether we use the mean or median to describe a dataset is largely dependent on the shape of our dataset and if there are any outliers. We will talk about this in just a bit!
```

### The Mode 
```
The most frequent number of data set 
```
```
The mode is the most frequently observed value in our dataset.

There might be multiple modes for a particular dataset, or no mode at all.

No Mode
If all observations in our dataset are observed with the same frequency, there is no mode. If we have the dataset:

1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4

There is no mode, because all observations occur the same number of times.

Many Modes
If two (or more) numbers share the maximum value, then there is more than one mode. If we have the dataset:

1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9

There are two modes 3 and 6, because these values share the maximum frequencies at 3 times, while all other values only appear once.
