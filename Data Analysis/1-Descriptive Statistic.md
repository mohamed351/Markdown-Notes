## Descriptive statistics

### Data Types
#### Quantitative
```
 data takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations (like the number of dogs).
```
#### Categorical  
```
re used to label a group or set of items (like dog breeds - Collies, Labs, Poodles, etc.).
```
### Quiz Data Types
#### Q1 > For each variable below, identify each as either quantitative or categorical.
```
Zip Code =>   Categorical 
Age => Quantitative
Income =>  Quantitative
Marital Status (Single, Married, Divorced, etc.) => Categorical
Height => Quantitative
```
#### Q2 > For each variable below, identify each as either quantitative or categorical.

```
Letter Grades (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, ...) => Categorical
Travel Distance to Work => Quantitative
Ratings on a Survey (Poor, Ok, Great) => Categorical
Temperature => Quantitative
Average Speed => Quantitative
```

### Data Types
#### Categorical Ordinal vs. Categorical Nominal
```
We can divide categorical data further into two types: Ordinal and Nominal.
```
```
Categorical Ordinal data take on a ranked ordering (like a ranked interaction on a scale from Very Poor to Very Good with the dogs).
```
```
Categorical Nominal data do not have an order or ranking (like the breeds of the dog).
```
### Continuous vs. Discrete
```
We can think of quantitative data as being either continuous or discrete.
```
```
Continuous data can be split into smaller and smaller units, and still a smaller unit exists. An example of this is the age of the dog - we can measure the units of the age in years, months, days, hours, seconds, but there are still smaller units that could be associated with the age.
```
```
Discrete data only takes on countable values. The number of dogs we interact with is an example of a discrete data type

## Summary of Data Types
```
The table below summarizes our data types. To expand on the information in the table, you can look through the text that follows.
```
| DataTypes | Continuous | Discrete |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Quantitative:	 | Height, Age, Income	 | Pages in a Book, Trees in Yard, Dogs at a Coffee Shop
 |


| DataTypes | Ordinal | Nominal |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Categorical:| Letter Grade, Survey Rating	 | Gender, Marital Status, Breakfast Items|

### Question 

```
This quiz will assure you have a clear understanding of the differences between categorical nominal vs. categorical ordinal variables. All of the variables below are categorical. Your task is to select the check box next to each variable that is nominal; do not check the ordinal categorical variables.

```

```
Letters Grades (A,B+, B-) etc . => Categorical Ordinal
Types of fruit => Categorical Nominal
Rating on Survey => (Poor, Ok , greate) => Categorical Oridinal
Types  of Dogs Breeds => Categorical Nomianal
Genres of movies => Categorical Nomianal
Geneder => Categorical Nominal 
Nationality => Categorical Nominal 
Education => Cateogorical Ordinal  
```

### Question 

```
This quiz will ensure you have a clear understanding of the differences between quantitative continuous vs. discrete variables. All of the variables below are quantitative. Your task is select the check box next to each variable that is continuous; do not check the discrete variables.
```


```
Travel  Distance from Home to Work  => Quantitive Continuos 
Number of pages in a book => Quantitive Discreate
Amount of rain in a Year => Quantitive Continuos
Time to run a Mile => Quantitive Continuous
Number of Movies Watched in a week => Quantitive Discrete

Amount of Water consumed in a Day => Quantitive Continous 
Number of phones per household => Quantive Discrete
